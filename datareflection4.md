**Use of Machine Learning in Paypal’s Fraud Detection**

Paypal is one major e-commerce company which uses machine learning algorithms to detect user and transaction fraud. With over 270 million accounts and over 5 million transactions a day, deep learning and other algorithms commonly used by financial institutions with predictive analysis are one of the few efficient ways to protect consumer data from fraud (Woodie 2019). Data breaches due to money laundering and fraud are the most common issues with payments made online, especially “card-not-present” transactions, so Paypal relies heavily on deep learning to improve fraud detection. 

Traditionally, financial institutions use logistic regressions as an approach to fraud detection. In this method, the data of authentic transactions is compared with the fraudulent transactions to create an algorithm. This model predicts whether a new transaction is a case of fraud or not (Menon 2020). Cases of fraud on user’s data and data breaches range from email phishing and payment fraud to identity theft and fake online accounts. One threat Paypal commonly faced in the past was account fraud, which is essentially a hacker accessing one’s PC and utilizing the user’s credentials to gain access to banking their information. Paypal advanced from logistic regressions to neural networks and Gradient Boosted Tree algorithms to improve fraud detection in threats such as account hacking. The most recent technique Paypal has utilized is deep learning in real time fraud detection which has had 10-20% more accuracy and efficiency over the other approaches of traditional machine learning (Woodie 2019).

Machine learning aids in the profitability of Paypal by reducing risk and fraud and increasing customer retention rate because it ensures customers’ accounts are secured and protected. If the service is fraud, the users’ trust in the Paypal brand is lost, making machine learning a key component to ensuring a good brand image by detecting potential signs of fraud (Burns 2016). “Features” detect these patterns of small purchases at various locations which result in fraud. The algorithm continuously learns and perfects its predictions over time as thousands of features are taken into account (Morisy 2020). The algorithm is trained by the users’ data by distinguishing between which transactions are considered “genuine” or “fraud” (features). For example, the algorithm learns the pattern difference between families paying for a meal and a thief making the same purchases on different accounts and detects future attempted scams. 

Deep learning is very efficient when training with a large repository of data, which Paypal contains. Performance is optimized as the data increases. Through a combination of linear, neural network, and deep learning algorithms, these applications have significantly improved the fraud detection system of Paypal. This has been proven over the years because the company has retained a relatively low fraud rate of 0.32 of revenue (Morisy 2020). Threats to consumer data are evolving in e-commerce, such as Paypal, so machine learning is a useful data science method to continue utilizing in this industry (Menon 2020).
