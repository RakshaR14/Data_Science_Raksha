**Use of Neural Networks to Detect COVID-19 Cases**

Detecting COVID-19 in x-ray scans of patients’ lungs with chest radiography (CR) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is very crucial in its diagnosis. Because this scanning can lead to similar x-ray imaging with other respiratory diseases, it’s also important to integrate other disciplines to confirm the accuracy of the x-ray. Other disciplines involving pathological x-rays only could target a single disease, so misclassification of the disease can occur, especially because there are a variety of ways COVID-19 manifests, from mild to more severe clinical symptoms. Another issue which arises from this method of diagnosis is there is a lack of radiologists, even with the ubiquitous availability of x-rays, in developing countries where COVID-19 is surging. Deep Neural Networks can potentially aid diagnosis with tailored solutions to these problems by essentially distinguishing the cases of COVID-19 from other respiratory infections while taking into consideration factors such as gender and age (Albahli 2020). 

The shortage of trained radiologists to examine and diagnose patients in developing countries is problematic for early detection of COVID-19, so many researchers have looked to AI and deep learning to investigate and analyze x-ray images. Applying deep learning could potentially provide many benefits. Recent studies of this application for detecting COVID-19 have shown neural networks are relatively accurate on balanced and unbalanced datasets. Balanced datasets are essentially containing equal amounts of negative and positive values while unbalanced datasets are when one outnumbers the other causing a high difference. The data is skewed to favor one class of subjects in an unbalanced dataset (Tripathi 2020). 

The DarkNet-19 algorithm is one approach which has proven to be most effective and optimal in early detection of COVID-19. The “optimal” network is based on this range of characteristics: high accuracy, less training time, and small-sized (Elgendi 2020). Relatively small-sized neural networks are beneficial because they require a significantly less amount of computational resources. Various other pre-trained neural networks such as ResNet50, InceptionV3 and InceptionResNetV2 are efficient in determining the radiographic detection of COVID-19, however DarkNet-19 outperformed these algorithms. Darknet-19's efficiency accuracy to identify radiographic patterns in conjunction with COVID-19 in portable and routine chest radiographs at the various stages of the virus gives its advantage. The disease progression can also be identified when distinguishing a “true positive” as opposed to other outcomes such as false and true negatives.

In conclusion, chest radiography alongside additional computerized radiography detection of COVID-19 is optimal for developing countries where the shortage of radiologists is prominent. Utilizing pre-trained networks is useful for early diagnosis as it is efficient, easily accessible, and accurate. It is also useful in areas where hospitals are overwhelmed and packed with patients, so the use of AI systems and deep learning to detect the disease is beneficial.
