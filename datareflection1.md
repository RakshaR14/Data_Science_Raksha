**Using Data Science to Further Mental Health Research**

Machine learning is a technique of data science which helps us better understand and even predict human behavior. It has been used by many medical researchers and practitioners to recognize patterns of behavior which have been previously otherwise hard to diagnose. The use of machine learning has prompted more efficient results and can help develop the treatments to be more tailored to the individual patient. This method of data science in mental health research is even beneficial in tackling the root of the problem, so it could also be used for prevention of mental health disorders and aid in determining if the patients are at risk of developing a mental illness.

One application of machine learning in mental health research is used in an online platform, Ginger.io. [Ginger.io](https://ginger.io/) uses machine learning through algorithms of its users and patient’s phone data to personalize their mental health support and connect them with professionals (Sennaar 2019). Another application of machine learning is used in Mindstrong Health, which essentially uses data from the user’s phone activity to detect triggers or signs of a mental health disorder diagnosis. There are many privacy concerns with the use of both of these apps.

Another widely-used technique of data science used to further mental health research is AI. Within the AI program of neural network algorithms, there is a method called SuperLearning under the R package, “Superlearner”. Superlearner is essentially an algorithm under supervised-learning, an algorithm which yields from existing, known data to predict the optimal outcome of unpredicted data. In Superlearning, its best, predicted outcome to a situation is derived from individual algorithms using cross-validation. It creates an “ensemble” from this model. Superlearner is beneficial for including predictions of various machine learning methods across the board (Jiang 2020). 

The application of the method, Superlearning, in improving mental health was recently used for predicting the psychiatric outcomes of substance abuse- related disorders. The following outcomes were used in this application: anxiety, panic, social phobia, depression, and mania (Jiang 2020). The algorithm was composed of linear and nonlinear classifiers (Rosellini, 2020). These classifiers are used based on the object’s number of features. These were then cross-validated, and Superlearner was able to range the patients’ predicted risk factors (low to high) of being diagnosed with a mental health disorder.
