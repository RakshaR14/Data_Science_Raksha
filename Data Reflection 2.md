**Using Machine Learning to Predict and Improve EMS Response Times**

Traditionally, many fire departments and other emergency medical services use geographic information systems (GIS) to reduce risk and increase efficiency by displaying, mapping and analyzing data graphically. GIS network tools like Network Analyst and ARCgis, can estimate and improve response time analysis, however, do not usually consider variables or impediments to the response time such as weather or traffic during a certain time of the day. External dynamic factors such as these can be considered with Machine Learning algorithms used to predict response times during emergencies, making ML a more beneficial tool for estimation for fire departments.

A few fire departments have started to use machine learning to predict the response times of firefighters, and they utilize this predicted data to lessen that response time and strategize more ways to decrease it. Response time of the fire firefighters is essentially split in two parts which are turnout and travel time. “Turnout” is how long it takes for them to prepare with their gear and equipment after the alarm at the station, and “travel” is how long it takes to arrive at the fire accident after departing the station. Before determining the prediction of turnout time, irregularities in the data made by the manual operations are cleansed (the cleaning process) to produce modified, uniform data that the ML algorithm can learn and is easier to understand (Pecararo 2018). Data cleansing is important for creating an accurate and reliable data set removing the irregularities such as errors and duplicates. The output of this turnout time data factors in the weather conditions, for example, turnout time increases in the winter because firefighters need more layers of clothes under their gear. Various fire departments units can be taken into consideration for travel time such as transportation by ladder truck, boat, trailer, etc. and can also implement two classes of units in the dataframe, such as faster or slower units. 

The prediction of the turnout time is determined by the algorithm applied in Machine Learning, XGBoost, which is relatively high in predictive power and efficient in its high performance and speed (Srivistava 2016). Montreal’s fire department’s baseline model consisted of the time of day, season, type of units and incidents, and fire station’s origin within the time range of 7 years were provided to XGBoost (Pecararo 2018), making it a very efficient tool. The prediction of travel time factors in the weather and the time of day due to the use of OSRM, a high-performance routing engine in ML, in which most GIS software systems cannot input. OSRM is beneficial for implementing nearest, shortest paths in road networks. The external features (weather and time) are taken into account for the estimated time when computing distances between points (fire department origin) and travel time matrices in the OSRM API package (Narendiran 2020). The traffic is also dependent on these features, which also influences the travel time.

Many emergency medical services and fire departments rely on GIS to predict response time, however, using machine learning can be more advantageous and lead to resolutions tailored to each fire department. Solutions can even include reinstating or opening a new fire station where response time is vastly decreased and improved.
