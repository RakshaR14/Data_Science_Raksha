# Project 2

I used Southwest(LUV) as my predicted stock and United Airlines Holdings(UAL), Jet Blue(JBLU), Delta(DAL), and Spirit(SAVE) as predictors. The matrix shows a positive, linear relationship between the closing prices of United Airlines Holdings, Jet Blue, Delta, and Spirit today and the predicted closing price of Southwest tomorrow.
