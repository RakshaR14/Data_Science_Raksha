# Project 3

I plotted the administrative boundaries of El Salvador using its local, district, and regional subdivisions from shapefiles.
The national boundary (SLV_0), first level administrative subdivisions (SLV_1) and second level administrative subdivisions (SLV_2) were obtained.

I created a larger map of El Salvador with rectangles identifying areas of detailed maps, showing its subdivisions. Detail A is a subplot of San Salvador, a highly dense city in El Salvador. San Salvador is also the capital of El Salvador. Detail B shows the subdivisions of Moraz√°n, a less densely populated region of El Salvador.
